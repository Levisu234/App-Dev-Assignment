"# App-Dev-Assignment" 
Creating a simple calculator using HTML,CSS and Java Script and uploading it on GITHUB. The challenges i had was placing the file in the respiratory because i need to be careful in order for me to put the right files. But so far the expierence was fun and it is easy to acces it in GITHUB.
